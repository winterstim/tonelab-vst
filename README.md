## 1. Plugin Installation

Download the latest plugin archive for your operating system (`.zip` files available on the releases page or after purchase).

### Windows Installation

1. Extract the downloaded `tonelab_vst_windows.zip` archive.
2. Double-click **`install_windows.bat`**.
3. It will ask for Administrator permissions in order to copy the plugin to the system folder (`C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`). Click **"Yes"**.
4. The script will automatically install the plugin. 
5. You're all set! The plugin is now available in your DAW.

### macOS Installation

1. **Extract** the `tonelab_vst_macos.zip` archive (do not run it directly from inside the zip).
2. **Right-click** (or Control-click) the **`install_mac.command`** script, select **Open**, and then click **Open** again if a security warning appears.
3. The Terminal will open. **Enter your Mac login password** and press Return (the characters won't appear as you type, this is normal).
4. The script will automatically copy the plugin to your VST3 folder and remove macOS security blocks!
5. You can now close the Terminal and launch your DAW.

**Alternative Manual Method:**
If the script doesn't work, you can do it manually:
1. Copy the `tonelab_vst.vst3` file.
2. Open **Finder**, press `Cmd + Shift + G`, type `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/`, and paste the plugin there.
3. Open Terminal and run: `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/tonelab_vst.vst3`

### Linux Installation

1. Extract the `tonelab_vst_linux.zip` archive.
2. Move the `tonelab_vst.vst3` file to the `~/.vst3/` directory (if the folder doesn't exist, create it).
3. Restart your DAW.

3. Open the plugin browser in your DAW and find the **VST3** section.
4. Locate **Tonelab VST** in the plugins list (it might be under the manufacturer's folder or in the general list) and drag it onto your track.
5. The main Tonelab interface window will open!

## 3. Interface Overview

The Tonelab interface consists of two main areas: a spacious workspace (Dashboard) for effect cards and a bottom control panel (Toolbar).


- **Workspace (Node Graph):** Here you visually build your effect chain. You can move cards around, connect them with wires, and adjust parameters for each effect.
- **Toolbar:** Located at the bottom center. It contains the Tonelab logo, icons for manually adding effects, and an options menu.
- **Update Notice:** If a critical or important update is available for the plugin, a subtle notification will appear at the top of the screen. Clicking it will start the installation of the latest version.

## 4. AI Sound Generation

The most powerful feature of Tonelab is its ability to generate a ready-to-use effect chain based on a text description.


1. Click on the **Tonelab AI** logo (the leftmost icon on the toolbar).
2. The toolbar will transform into a text input field.
3. Type the sound you want to achieve. For example: *"Make a warm distortion with long reverb and a slight delay"*.
4. Press `Enter` on your keyboard or click the white submit button on the right side of the input field.


**Authorization & Subscription:**
- If this is your first request, the plugin will pause and automatically open a page in your web browser.
- Log in to your account on the opened Tonelab website page (you must have an active subscription).
- After successfully logging in, return to your DAW — the plugin will detect your authorization and continue loading your chain.
- The AI will automatically place the necessary effects on the screen with optimal parameter settings and wire them together.

## 5. Manual Chain Creation & Editing

You can build chains from scratch or tweak the ones generated by the AI.

### Adding Effects
The toolbar contains icons for basic effects: Equalizer, Overdrive, Noise Gate, Reverb, Delay. Simply click on an icon, and the corresponding effect card will appear in the center of the screen.

### Connecting Effects
To route audio from one effect to another:
1. Click and hold the left mouse button on the circle (output node) on the right side of an effect card.
2. Drag the wire that appears to the circle (input node) on the left side of another card, then release the button.
3. To delete a wire, just click on the effect and delete it by selecting it and pressing `Backspace` or `Delete`.

### Adjusting Knobs
Each card contains parameter knobs. To adjust them:
- Click and hold the left mouse button on a knob.
- Drag your mouse up or down to smoothly change the value.
- To remove an effect from the screen, click it to select it and press `Delete` or `Backspace` on your keyboard. You can also use the number keys (e.g., `1` or `2`) to quickly spawn certain effects.

## 6. Activating the Effect Chain

For the plugin to start processing your audio, you need to tell it exactly which chain you want to listen to. This allows you to keep multiple ideas or guitar tone variations on the same screen.


1. Hold down the `Shift` key on your keyboard and click sequentially connected effects to **select** them. (They will be highlighted with a visual outline).
2. Select the entire chain from start to finish.
3. Once the plugin recognizes that you've selected a valid chain, an **Activation (Play)** button will pop up near the toolbar.
4. Click this button. The chain will be locked into the plugin's active memory, and your DAW's audio will start being processed through these effects! To turn off processing, click the button again (Stop).

## 7. Options Menu


On the right side of the toolbar, there is a button with three dots `...`. Clicking it opens a pop-up menu:
- **Documentation:** Opens the documentation and tutorials in your web browser.
- **Personal Cabinet:** Opens your personal profile page where you can check your subscription status, profile details, and billing.
